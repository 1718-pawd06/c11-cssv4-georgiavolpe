<!--First paragraph: Explains what art is-->
	<p>When people think of art, they may imagine paintings or drawings, but that
is not always the case. So, what defines art? "Art" can range from
advertisements, the strum of a guitar, the way someone walks, the
directions the grass grows, etc!</p>

<!--Second paragraph: Different kinds of art/mediums-->
<p>Traditional art is probably what most people think of when they hear the
word "art." The term "traditional" implies sculptures, portraits, and other
man-made pieces. Since technology continues to develop over the years,
there is also another category of art that has emerged called "digital" art. This
could be used to make commercials or advertisements, but many just use it
to create what they want!</p> 

<!--Third paragraph: Introduces Julia Razumova's digital art-->
<p>Julia Razumova is a popular artist on social media that specializes in
drawing digital portraits. Sometimes, people send her pictures of
themselves and ask for her to illustrate them. You can see some of Julia's
art <a href="https://www.artstation.com/juliabsss">here.</a></p>

<!--Fourth paragraph: Introduces Emilio Villalba's traditional art--> 
<p>Emilio Villalba is an artist in New York who paints portraits in a way not
many would expect. "I've always been fascinated by the mess," he states.
Emilio is very well known for his unique and abstract depiction of what, or
who, people really are. You can see more of his art on his website 
<a href="http://emiliovillalbaart.com/collections/">here.</a></p>
